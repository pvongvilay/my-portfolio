This is my personal portfolio, that is still in progress. I will be adding more to my work when i am able to showcase more of my work! -
-My motivation begin this was that i am able to show off my previous work, tell you about my self and a way to contact me in my own creative way.
-I built this project because its my portfolo! i will be using this for as long as i am a developer
-I learned that it was pretty hard trying to make a application with my own code, and this is because i am just a beginner at this so i am still learning.
